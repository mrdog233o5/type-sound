        <li>a terminal emulator, all the steps after will be done in this app using command line</li>
        <li>change directory into the type-sound folder using <span class="codeBlock">cd (path of the folder)</span></li>
        <li>setup all the files of type-sound, you can use the script i made to automatically setup: <span class="codeBlock">bash ./setup.sh</span></li>
        <li>install homebrew from <a href="https://brew.sh/">https://brew.sh/</a></li>

    <h1>Config</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>find any sound you want, ANY, even meme sounds.</li>
        <li>convert the sound you got to .WAV format using any tools, i suggest https://cloudconvert.com/ because it is free, but you can use any tools you want, as long as the output sound is in .WAV format.</li>
        <li>rename the sound files EXACTLY like this structure:
            <pack_name>									#any name you like for the pack
             ├── press.wav							#sound played when pressed a key
             ├── release.wav 						#sound played when released a key
             ├── mousePress.wav 				#sound played when pressed mouse
             └── mouseRelease.wav				#sound played when released mouse
        put the whole folder directly into `./.config/type-sound/sounds` aka `/Users/(your user name)/.config/type-sound/sound/sounds`</li>
        <li>this is a hidden folder as it starts with a dot, so you have to press `command+shift+period(.)` to enable displaying hidden folders.</li>
        <li>the sound pack is added correctly if you followed the steps above correctly. To tell type-sound to use that sound pack, open `./.config/type-sound/type-sound.json` aka `/Users/(your user name)/.config/type-sound/type-sound.json` with a text editor.</li>
        <li>when you open it, it should look like something like this:
        <span class="codeBlock">
        {
            "pack":(soundpack that you are using),
        }
        </span>
        remember to save and reopen type-sound when you made any changes</li>
    </ol>
